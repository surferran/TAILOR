    "This notebook show how to start a *very simple* bokeh server application *programmatically*.  For more complex examples, or for the more standard command line interface, see the [Bokeh documentation](http://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/docs/user_guide/server.html).\n",

    "\n",
    "Many people know Bokeh as a tool for building web visualizations from languages like Python.  However I find that Bokeh's true value is in serving live-streaming, interactive visualizations that update with real-time data.  I personally use Bokeh to serve real-time diagnostics for a distributed computing system.  In this case I embed Bokeh directly into my library.  I've found it incredibly useful and easy to deploy sophisticated and beaufitul visualizations that help me understand the deep inner-workings of my system.\n",

    "Most of the (excellent) documentation focuses on stand-alone applications using the Bokeh server\n",
    "\n",
    "    $ bokeh serve myapp.py\n",
    "    \n",
    "However I mostly deal with programmers who would prefer to execute things programmatically.  I thought I'd provide some examples on how to do this within a Jupyter notebook."

    "\n",
    "Bokeh handles this by keeping a synchronized table of data on the client and the server.  This is the `ColumnDataSource`.  If you define plots around the column data source and then push more data into the source then Bokeh will handle the rest, synchronizing the plots on the screen with the data that you provide.\n",

    "In the example below every time someone connects to our server we make a new `ColumnDataSource`, make a function that will add a new record into it, and set up a calllback to call that function every 100ms.  We then make a plot around that data source to render the data as colored circles.\n",
